# **Introduction**
Agent Tesla is a .Net-based Remote Access Trojan (RAT) and data stealer for gaining initial access that is often used for Malware-As-A-Service (MaaS). In this criminal business model, threat actors known as initial access brokers (IAB) outsource their specialized skills for exploiting corporate networks to affiliate criminal groups. As first-stage malware, Agent Tesla provides remote access to a compromised system that is then used to download more sophisticated second-stage tools, including ransomware.

# **Key points**

In this document, we will take a deep dive into steps the malware takes to execute the payload through these layers, as well as the various techniques it employs to hinder and slow down the analysis process.

Some of these significant features include:

- Use of AES256 encryption in javascript using "RijindaelManaged" .NET encryption module
- Use of images to hide base64 encoded .NET PEs
- Use of **fileless loader** in the infection chain helps the IoC's threat to be undiscovered.
- **Process Hollowing** has been implemented in the final stages of the loader, wherein the code of RegAsm.exe is replaced with the payload associated with Tesla.

# **1st stage**
The initial javascript payload is started from a document. In this specific case, an excel document created a wscript process executing the following javascript code:

In this case, an URL is istantiated to retrieve more javascript code, to be executed in memory with the "eval" function.
